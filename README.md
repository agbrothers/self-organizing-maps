An exploration into Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and competitive learning for spatial memory. In particular, 
I'm interested in emergent phenomena similar to the activations of:
* [Place Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_cell)
* [Head Direction Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_direction_cell)
* [Boundary Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_cell)
* [Grid Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_cell)

These cells are critical to navigation and memory, located largely in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex - fairly 
old regions of the brain in evolutionary terms. By understanding how representations form for 2 and 3-dimensional 
space, we can potentially gain a better understanding of how the neocortex might use similar mechanisms to represent 
higher-dimensional information, like concepts and language.
